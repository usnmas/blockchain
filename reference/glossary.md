## FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)

The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association launched in February 2013 whose mission is to develop and promote **authentication standards that help reduce the worldâ€™s over-reliance on passwords**. FIDO addresses the lack of interoperability among strong authentication devices and reduces the problems users face creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords.
